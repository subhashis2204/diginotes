                The article discusses the lack of emphasis on soft skills in
                finance, leading to little improvement in the industry despite
                attracting top talent. It highlights the stories of a janitor
                who became wealthy through savings and investments, and a former
                Merrill Lynch executive who lost everything due to poor
                financial decisions. The author questions whether we have truly
                learned from trial and error in personal finance.
